  ReleaseIQ features with New Relic
  - Custom Events: During pipeline execution for each step, events with all step information is sent to New Relic. To enable this feature, you will need to configure a notification to New Relic in each step.
  - Deployment Verification: Deployments can be verified by New Relic based on the New Relic policies configured in deploy step of a pipeline. Then based on the priority, alerts will be sent back to the ReleaseIQ platform. The progress of pipeline to subsequent steps will be based on deployment verification result.
