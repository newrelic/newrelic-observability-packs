  The Delphix quickstart for New Relic grants insights and observability of the Delphix Platform to administrators. Users may monitor various Delphix objects, such as dSources and VDBs, and trigger alerts on exceeded thresholds. 

  In addition, when leveraging the [Delphix integration](https://github.com/delphix/dct-newrelic-integration), users can feed data into triggered New Relic workflows to command data-ready RCA environments through a [ServiceNow automated request](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/bb688f9f9734111012b7318c1253af11) or direct webhook.
