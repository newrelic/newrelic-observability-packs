description: |
  SendGrid provides a cloud-based service that assists businesses with email delivery. In order to integrate SendGrid Events with New Relic, you will need to send SendGrid events by using the SendGrid Event Webhook. If you are already sending events to AWS S3 using the SendGrid Event Webhook, these events can be transferred to New Relic by using NewRelic-log-ingestion-s3.
