# New Relic One Observability Packs

> ðŸ§ª This project is currently in an `ALPHA` state ðŸ§ª

New Relic One observability packs jump start your New Relic journey by providing immediate value for your specific use cases. They include:

- Clear steps for instrumenting your services
- Observability building blocks like dashboards and alerts

All of this is available through an open ecosystem where New Relic developers, partners, and customers contribute their best-practice solutions.

## Getting Started

Contribute your own observability pack to the New Relic One catalog by following the steps below:

1. [Fork the Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)

2. [Clone your own repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

3. Copy the `_template` directory and its content to a new directory within the `packs` folder. Choose a name which identifies the purpose of your pack, such as `rabbitmq`, `apm-errors`, `sre`, or `aws-s3`

4. In your new directory, you'll find the following folders: `dashboards`, `alerts`, `flex`, and `synthetics`. Each folder contains a template that you can use to create entities for your observability pack.

    For example, to add an existing dashboard to your new observability pack, [copy the dashboard's JSON](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/#dash-json), and save it as a JSON file in the `dashboards` directory. Next, create a screenshot of your dashboard, add it to `dashboards`, and give it the same name as your JSON file.

    > **Note:** You can add multiple JSON files and screenshots to `dashboards`. Pair each screenshot with a JSON file by using the same file name. If you want multiple screenshots for a dashboard, add a number at the end of the file name. So, your `dashboards` folder might contain:

      - `rabbitmq.json`
      - `rabbitmq.png` or `rabbitmq.jpeg`
      - `rabbitmq01.png`
      - `rabbitmq02.png`

    This process is similar for all other entity directories. Also, if you don't want to create entities for a given type, you can simply delete the corresponding directory.

5. In your pack's root directory, you'll find a `config.yaml` file. Set the name of your pack. Everything else is optional.

6. Commit your changes using the [Conventional Commit syntax](./CONTRIBUTING.md#using-conventional-commits):

    ```sh
    git add -A
    git commit -m "feat([name]): Added [name]"
    ```

    Change the `[name]` and add a description of the dashboard you've added.

7. Push your changes to Github:

    ```sh
    git push
    ```

8. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) in the [parent repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-observability-packs/compare?expand=1).

9. Submit and wait for review. We will review as fast as we can, but it can sometimes take a day or two.

Thanks a lot for your submission!

## Testing

### Importer

We've included an `importer` utility for testing packs on your account. You can run this using the included [import.sh](./import.sh) script.

> Note: The importer spins up a docker container, so you must have docker installed and running for this to function

1. Modify [importer-config.sh](./importer-config.sh) with your account number and New Relic API Key
2. Run [import.sh](./import.sh) from the root of this project:

   ```bash
   # Usage:
   ./import.sh $PACK_NAME

   # Example
   > ./import.sh mysql
   ```

## Support

New Relic hosts and moderates an online forum where customers can interact with New Relic employees as well as other customers to get help and share best practices. Like all official New Relic open source projects, there's a related Community topic in the New Relic Explorers Hub. You can find this project's topic/threads here:
