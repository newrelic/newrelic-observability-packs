  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for TypeScript

  The majority of realistic application UI scenarios are optimized for high performance using Flutter. The optimal performance, however, depends on developers implementing the right patterns and features. Use your application rendition's dashboard to visually track the web user experience worldwide.

  ## Why monitor TypeScript?

  When working on your TypeScript app, you want proactive notifications on build errors as early as possible. In addition to this benefit, monitoring your TypeScript app also:

  - Simplifies monitoring complex systems
  - Warns you when it detects a vulnerability
  - Gives dynamic visualizations of your TypeScript app's performance through New Relic's easy to use dashboards
  - Gives developers and QA engineers detailed reporting from API tests and monitors, which allows them to quickly diagnose, debug, and remediate in a collaborative environment.

  ## What should you look for in a TypeScript monitor?

  - Application error rate
  - Error duration
  - Count of requests
  - Log data
  - Event loop times
  - Average response time

  ## What’s included in this quickstart?

  - Monitor web transactions
  - High-value alerts
  - Code-related insights that acquaint developers with the intricate details of their application’s health and status by providing detailed information on errors, database queries, and transaction traces
  - Alerts that proactively inform developers about the status of their applications

  ## What makes this quickstart unique?

  With this quickstart, you can monitor health and status in one place, focus on the most important information, and act on preventative maintenance strategies.
