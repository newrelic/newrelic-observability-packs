  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for Nuxt.js

  Nuxt.js would help developers build first-class Server Side Rendered applications through which a Node.js server can easily deliver the HTML format to the client based on your Vue components instead of using the client-side to run JavaScript.

  ### Why monitor Nuxt.js?

  By monitor allows us to know what issues customers are having in real time and provides an intuitive way to understand those issues, direct those issues to the proper party for resolution.

  ### Whatâ€™s included in this quickstart?

  - Alerts
  - Dashboards (Throughput, Error rate, Logs, Web transaction Time,Apdex Score and more)
  - Monitor scripts and functions
  - Monitor web transaction

summary: |
  Nuxt.js is a framework that helps you build server-rendered Vue.js applications easily. It abstracts most of the complex configuration involved in managing things like asynchronous data, middleware, and routing.
