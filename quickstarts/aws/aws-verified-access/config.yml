  ## What is Amazon Verified Access?

  AWS Verified Access allows you to provide secure network access without a VPN to corporate applications. Verified Access verifies each access request in real time and only connects users to the applications they are allowed to access, removing broad access to corporate applications, and reducing the associated risks.
