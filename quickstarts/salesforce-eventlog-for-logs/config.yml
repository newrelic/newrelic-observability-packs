  ## What is Salesforce Event Log?

  Salesforce event log refers to a log file generated when an event occurs in your organization. There are up to 50 event types that can be consumed. Some of the event types include logins, logouts, visualforce page loads, report exports, apex executions, URI (web clicks in Salesforce Classic), application programming interface (API) calls, etc. To collect Salesforce event log data, you have to have read access to the Salesforce event log and enable the Salesforce event log file API. Create a Salesforce 'Connected App' to use OAuth authentication.
