  ## Comprehensive MERN Stack Monitoring System
  MERN Stack is a widely used open-source framework that is based on JavaScript and is used to create dynamic web pages and online applications. The framework comprises of four components, namely MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS, all of which play a vital role in the development of web applications. These four technologies integrate seamlessly and logically, making it easy to build web applications using the MERN Stack. Each of these components is based on JavaScript and JSON, which makes the integration process simpler and more efficient.
