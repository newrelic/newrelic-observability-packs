  ## Sendmail performance monitoring
  Sendmail performance monitoring involves monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of the message delivery in Sendmail and identifying any issues or bottlenecks that may affect email delivery on time.
  Effective Sendmail performance monitoring ensures that the email system operates smoothly, messages are processed efficiently, and potential issues are promptly identified and addressed, leading to reliable and timely delivery of email messages.
  ### What should you look for in a Sendmail dashboard?
  There are several important factors and indicators that must be taken seriously when assessing a Sendmail dashboard. These incorporate backlog analysis, delivery success rate, error tracking, and message processing.
