  ## What is F5?

  F5 is a set of application delivery products that work together to ensure high availability, improved performance, application security, and access control.

  ## Get started!

  Use New Relic's F5 BIG-IP integration to collect and send inventory and metrics from your F5 BIG-IP instance, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics.

  We collect data at the system, node, pool, pool member, and virtual server levels.

  Follow the [F5 monitoring integration documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/f5-monitoring-integration) to get started.
