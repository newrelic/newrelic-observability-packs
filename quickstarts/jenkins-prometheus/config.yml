  ## What is Jenkins?

  The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.
  
  ## Jenkins (Prometheus) quickstart highlights

  The New Relic quickstart uses dashboards to proactively monitor your jenkin servers, like:

  - jenkins health
  - jenkins total jobs/successful jobs/failure jobs
  - jenkins last build status
  - jenkins queue rate

  ### Requirements:
  #### Prometheus Remote Write
  1. [Prometheus Server](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)
  2. Enable Prometheus [Remote Write](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/) to New Relic.
  
  you will need to add the following scrape configuration to your `prometheus.yml` config file:
  Reload the promethues configuration
    ```
    - job_name: "jenkins"  
    params:
      format: ["prometheus"]
    metrics_path: "prometheus"
    scheme: "http"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
    ````
