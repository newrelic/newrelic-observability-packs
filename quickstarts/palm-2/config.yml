  ## Why should you monitor your usage of PaLM 2?
  Monitor your application powered by PaLM 2 language models to ensure, get visibility to what you send to PaLM 2, responses received from PaLM 2, latency, usage and errors. By monitoring the usage, you can infer the cost. 
  ### Track the LLM's performance:
  Monitor the input & output, latency and errors of your LLM provider. Track performance changes with the providers and versions of your LLM. Monitor usage to understand the cost, rate limits, and general performance.
  ### Track your app:
  By tracking key metrics like latency, throughput, error rates, and input & output, you can gain insights into your PaLM 2 app's performance and identify areas of improvement. 
  ### Early issue detection:
  Detect and address issues early to prevent them from affecting model performance. 

  ## Comprehensive PaLM 2 monitoring quickstart
  Our PaLM 2 quickstart provides metrics including error rate, input & output, latency, queries, and lets you integrate with different language models.

  ## What’s included in the PaLM 2 quickstart?
