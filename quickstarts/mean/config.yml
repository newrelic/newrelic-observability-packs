  ## Comprehensive MEAN Stack Monitoring System
  A JavaScript-based open-source framework called MEAN Stack is used for creating dynamic web pages and online applications. 
  There are four components in the stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular and NodeJS. The stack's components integrate logically and simply because they are all based on JavaScript and JSON. These four powerful technologies all play an important role in the creation of web applications.

  ## What should you look for in a MEAN dashboard?
  - Metrics related to MongoDB including active connections, database details, usage time, and more.
  - There are many metrics available for ExpressJS and NodeJS including web transactions, top ten transactions and errors, memory usage, and many others. 
  - There are many different Angular metrics including the number of viewed urls, page views by city, ajax requests, etc. You may also create your own chart using the collected metrics.

  ## What’s included in the MEAN quickstart?
  Install this quickstart to install preconfigured observability solutions:
  - A number of high-value alerts are available including the average number of connections created, the FCP score and the memory usage.
  - Informative dashboards (the top 10 transactions, connections, database indexes, and more).
