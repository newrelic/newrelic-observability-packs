  ## React Native Quickstart

  React Native is a technology which brings the power of the React.js frontend javascript framework to mobile devices.Mobile programming brings with it a unique set of challenges. These devices have sensors such as the touchscreen, accelerometer, and gyroscope that interface with the world and send data back to the application. An effective mobile application must make use of this unique data and also be able to detect and fail gracefully when a sensor fails. 

  Programming for mobile devices introduces hardware constraints, so monitoring and managing memory consumption and CPU usage become very important. New Relic provides a React Native Quickstart that allows developers to monitor their mobile applications, giving them full control and peace of mind over their application’s performance.

  ### New Relic - React Native Quickstart Features

  ## Get started!
  The [React Native Quickstart](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2020/10/three-big-updates-your-native-mobile-apps/) provides both visual dashboards and alerts that provide comprehensive React Native monitoring. These include…

  Dashboards
  - Transaction overview - an overview of all JS transactions initiated and received by React Native
  - Top OS’s - the top mobile OS’s on which users are accessing a React Native app
  - Top 10 transactions - the top 10 app transactions being made at any given time
  - Most popular methods - most popular app methods as decided by user application usage
  - Average interaction duration(s) - average time spent by users interacting with the RN app

   Alerts
   - Low APDEX score - alerts the developer when the apdex score falls below a certain threshold
   - Transaction errors - alerts the developer when the number of transaction errors climbs above a certain threshold

  ### New Relic - Complete React Native Dashboard Tool

  The dashboards and alerts allow developers to extensively optimize their React Native applications and they are the ultimate React Native performance monitor. For example, understanding the Top OS’s allows users to understand which devices are primarily being used to access their applications. While React Native apps are cross-platform, there are still actions that can be taken to optimize for one platform vs. another, i.e. Android vs. Apple or vice versa. The Top OS’s dashboard allows developers to decide how to best enhance OS-specific application performance.

  Similarly, understanding interaction duration can help developers to understand which application features are popular. They can then add or remove features to help increase average interaction duration and improve the app’s popularity or usefulness.

summary: The React Native Quickstart is the ultimate performance monitoring solution for mobile applications. The included dashboards and alerts allow developers to optimize their application’s usability and understand how changes impact its performance.
