  ## Why monitor JFrog Platform

  The JFrog Platform is a leading universal end-to-end DevOps platform for automating, managing, securing, distributing, orchestrating, monitoring, and optimizing your Cl/ CD pipeline. These different elements of the JFrog platform need to be monitored in order for the enterprise to know in real-time about the health, performance and security of the DevOps supply chain.
