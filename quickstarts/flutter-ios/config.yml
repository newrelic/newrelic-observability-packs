  ## Why monitor Flutter iOS?
  Monitoring app performance helps you to take a preventative approach to enhance quality rather than waiting for a crash, issue, or user complaint to occur. The Newrelic Flutter APM tool allows you to track important metrics including Apdex ratings, UI hangs, network timeouts and issues, slow launches, tracking custom traces, and more.
   
  By prioritizing active issues and marking errors as corrected, you may optimize the process once you have a comprehensive picture of all releases. Find out which version the problem first appeared in, merge duplicates, and assess whether anything may get worse in a later release. Add commit information to send deploy emails instantly and suggest an owner for each application error.


  ## Whatâ€™s included in this quickstart?
  New Relic's iOS agent captured the metrics out of the box:

  - Alerts.
  - Dashboards (Http erros, Http response time, Applications installtions, Application crashes and Errors).
  - Monitor scripts and functions.
  - Monitor web transactions.
