  ## What is Jenkins?

  The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

  ### Get started!

  Start monitoring Jenkins jobs and pipeline executions in New Relic!

  Check out our Monitoring Jenkins with OpenTelemetry and New Relic documentation to instrument your Jenkins instance with the OpenTelemetry plugin for Jenkins.

  ### More info

  Check out the [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitoring-jenkins-ot/) to learn more about New Relic monitoring for Jenkins.

  ### Tie software performance to recent changes and deployments with New Relic change tracking

  With [New Relic change tracking](https://newrelic.com/platform/change-tracking), engineers now have the context to quickly understand the impact of changes on a system's performance and quality---then take action to find and fix problems fast.
  - See deployments in context with errors, logs, traces, incidents, and more.
  - Correlate deployments and change events to shifts in golden signals, errors, log attributes, incidents, and other key metrics.
  - Automatically mark charts with change details and metadata from any source, including the [Jenkins](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/change-tracking/ci-cd/change-tracking-jenkins/) plugin.

  Learn how to automatically record deployments with the brand new [GraphQL API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-graphql/), [New Relic CLI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-cli/), and third-party CI/CD sources in the [docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction/).
