  # What is Ansible?
  Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.

  Designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time.

  It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.

  # What does New Relic provide
  New Relic has developed a Ansible role for the Ansible agent to deploy the [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring/), [New Relic Application Performance Monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/configure-new-relic-agents/) and [On Host Integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations) throughout your environment.

  # How to get started?
  Follow the instructions on New Relic documentation: [Configure the infrastructure agent using Ansible](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/config-management-tools/configure-infrastructure-agent-using-ansible)
