  The ProxySQL quickstart allows you to get visibility into the performance and available of your ProxySQL service and dependencies. Use this quickstart together with the mock up integrations.

     # ProxySQL quickstart highlights

  The New Relic quickstart uses dashboards to proactively monitor your ProxySQL servers, like;
  - number of active transactions
  - query cache efficiency
  - monitor the rate of slow queries
  
     ## Monitoring ProxySQL

  This quickstart utilizes New Relic's ability to ingest Prometheus data (either from our OpenMetrics integration or via Prometheus remote write). See instructions for [sending Prometheus data to New Relic here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

     ### How do I configure my integration to scrape ProxySQL severs?

  The approach to getting your Prometheus metrics into New Relic differs depending on which integration you use.

     #### Prometheus Remote Write

  In addition to setting up your `remote_write` configuration as described [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/), you will need to add the following scrape configuration to your `prometheus.yml` config file

  ```
  - job_name: 'proxysql'
    metrics_path: "/metrics"
    scheme: http
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['your_proxysql_server_here:6070']
  ```
