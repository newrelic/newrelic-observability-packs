  - Apache: Requests per second, bytes per second, workers status, etc
  - MySQL: Operations per second, InnoDB read & writes, etc
  - Python: Throughput, transaction overview, WSGI, etc
  - In addition, you are free to create your own charts using the stored metrics

  - Application metrics with your server’s primary health metrics, like CPU usage, memory, disk usage and more
  - Multiple high-value alerts including latest number of questions per second, error transactions percentage, memory usage and CPU utilization
