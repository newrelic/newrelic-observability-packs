  Official New Relic dashboard for Prometheus Node Exporter. Node Exporter allows host metrics gathered by the exporter to be scraped by Prometheus Server.

  ## Dashboard Highlights
  - Load Averages
  - CPU
  - Memory Usage
  - Storage Usage
  - Network

  ## Requirements:
  1. [Prometheus Server](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)
  2. [Node Exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/) installed
  3. Enable Prometheus [Remote Write](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/) to New Relic.
  4. To be able to filter metrics by a specific label that isn't part of the Node Exporter default installation, an `external_label` will need to be added to the Prometheus config. Example:
      `
        global:
          external_labels:
            clusterName: <cluster_name>
      `
