  ## Why monitor CherryPy?

  CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web framework that enables developers to build web applications. Monitoring CherryPy is critical to identify and track performance metrics like apdex, key transactions, error traces, and database query traces. Proactively monitor CherryPy with our  New Relic CherryPy Quickstart’s out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts.

  ### CherryPy quickstart highlights
