  ## 1. Launch Count:
  -  This metric tracks the number of times an application is launched on mobile devices. It provides insights into user engagement and application popularity. Monitoring launch count helps developers and product managers understand user behavior, identify trends, and gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns or feature updates.

  ## 2. Crash Count:
  -  Crash count measures the frequency of application crashes on mobile devices. It indicates the stability and reliability of the application. Monitoring crash count allows developers to identify and prioritize fixing critical bugs or issues that lead to crashes, thereby improving the overall user experience and preventing user frustration or app abandonment.

  ## 3. Network Failures Count:
  - Network failures count monitors the number of times mobile applications encounter failures or errors related to network connectivity, such as timeouts, connection errors, or server unavailability. It highlights potential issues with network infrastructure, server-side services, or client-server communication protocols. Monitoring network failures count helps developers diagnose and troubleshoot network-related issues promptly, ensuring seamless connectivity and uninterrupted app functionality for users.

  ## 4. HTTP Response Time (ms): :
  - HTTP response time measures the duration it takes for a mobile application to receive responses from server requests over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It reflects the performance and responsiveness of backend services and APIs accessed by the application. Monitoring HTTP response time helps developers identify performance bottlenecks, optimize server-side processing, and improve overall app responsiveness. Additionally, monitoring response time variations can alert developers to potential network congestion or server overload issues, enabling proactive measures to maintain optimal app performance.
