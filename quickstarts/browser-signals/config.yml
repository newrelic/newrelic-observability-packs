  ## 1. Core Web Vitals Score:
  - The CWV Score is a composite metric that measures the quality of user experience on a webpage based on three factors: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

  ## 2. Pages Per Minute (Throughput):
  - This metric indicates the rate at which pages are served to users, measured in pages per minute.

  ## 3. Errors:
  - This metric counts the number of errors that have occurred.

  ## 4. Average PageLoad:
  - This metric measures the average time it takes for a page to load, in seconds.


  ### Actionable Takeaways:
  - Investigate the cause of the decreased throughput (Pages Per Minute) to determine if there are any performance bottlenecks or issues that need to be addressed.
  - Continue to monitor the CWV Score and aim to maintain or improve the current level, as it is indicative of a good user experience.
  - Look into the increased average page load time to identify any new changes or issues that may be contributing to slower load times. Consider optimizing resources, reviewing recent code deployments, or checking server performance.

    description: Our browser monitoring provides a real user monitoring (RUM) solution. It measures speed and performance as your end users navigate to your site through different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. But browser monitoring goes far beyond providing information about the initial page load. Use it to measure full page life cycle data and start getting the info you need to help ensure customer satisfaction.
