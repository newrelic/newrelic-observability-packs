  ## Zebrium

  Zebrium Root Cause as a Service reduces downtime by helping users find the root cause of problems more quickly. It works by using statistical machine learning on logs and achieves a proven accuracy rate of 95%. This is done without any manual training or rules. When there's a problem, you can now automatically see the root cause directly on any New Relic dashboard.


  ### How to use Zebrium

  - Send your logs to Zebrium by installing an open source log collector (Zebrium does not retain your logs, it analyzes them inline). 
  - When you know there is a problem, simply look at the Zebrium dashboard and you will see root cause indicators to explain what happened

  ### Benefits

  - For problems that require digging through logs, speed up resolution by 10x
  - Proactively catch problems without requiring any rules
  - Reduce the burden on engineering, SREs and Devops when solving complex incidents

  ### The Zebrium quickstart includes a dashboard that shows:

  - A vertical bar whenever Zebrium detects a potential problem
  - A listing of Zebrium detection summaries that includes an NLP generated summary and a link to the full report in the Zebrium UI
  - Metric charts showing log counts, error counts and anomaly counts
