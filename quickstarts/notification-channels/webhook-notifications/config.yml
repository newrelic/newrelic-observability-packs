description: |

  Webhook is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks.

  Integrate New Relic with Webhook to use the webhook notifier to send the notification messages to any endpoint you like.

  [Check out our documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations/#webhook) to set up a Webhook notification channel and provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents
