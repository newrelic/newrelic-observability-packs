title: New Relic Ingest Metric
description: |
  This quickstart provides a synthetic monitor (and associated dashboard) that will regularly query ingest for each data type (APM Events, Infrastructure Processes, etc.) and post it to the Metric API as a custom metric `newrelic-ingest-metric`. This means that you can query and analyze ingest across your account for 13 months by default, instead of 8 days for events, 30 days for  Logs, etc. The custom metric also includes a facet for each data type, so that you can see, for example, ingest for Mobile Events by appName or Logging by labels.app. The following parameters have default values but are all configurable:
  - ingest interval (hourly, daily, weekly)
  - facet for each data type
  - name of custom metric
  - addition of custom events
summary: |
  Use this script to set up a synthetic monitor that:
  1. Queries ingestion by data source, faceted by the attribute of your choice (e.g., APM Events by appName)
  2. Transforms the output into a metric that is pushed to the Metric API
  3. Can be queried for consumption analysis / dashboards for 13 months
