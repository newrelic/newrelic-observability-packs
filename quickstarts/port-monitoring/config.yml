  ## Why port monitoring?

  A port is a point where network connections start and end. It is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or service. The New Relic port monitoring quickstart empowers you to monitor the status of networking ports such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

  ### Port quickstart highlights

  The New Relic port monitoring quickstart has the following features:
  Dashboards: Our dashboards effectively track metrics like total ports open, latest port connected, samples/port, open ports’ timeseries, and open ports by host.
  Detailed installation, configuration, and changelog details in [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-port-monitor).

  ### New Relic + port = Optimum performance monitoring
