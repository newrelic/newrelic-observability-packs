  ## Why should you monitor your usage of Ollama?
  Monitor your application powered by Ollama language models to ensure, get visibility to what you send to Ollama, responses received from Ollama, latency, usage and errors. By monitoring the usage, you can infer the cost. 
  ### Track the LLM's performance: 
  Monitor the input & output, latency and errors of your LLM provider. Track performance changes with the providers and versions of your LLM. Monitor usage to understand the cost, rate limits, and general performance.
  ### Track your app:
  By tracking key metrics like latency, throughput, error rates, and input & output, you can gain insights into your LangChain app's performance and identify areas of improvement. 
  ### Early issue detection:
  Detect and address issues early to prevent them from affecting model performance. 

  ## Comprehensive Ollama monitoring quickstart
  Our Ollama quickstart provides metrics including error rate, input & output, latency, queries, and lets you integrate with different language models.
