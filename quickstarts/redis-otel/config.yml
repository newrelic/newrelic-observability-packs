  ## How to monitor Redis with New Relic?
  The OpenTelemetry Redis receiver collects metrics from your running Redis instances. These metrics provide insights into operations, memory usage, client connections, and more.
  A New Relic entity will be created for each Redis instance, allowing you to easily explore, configure alerts, and compare metrics for all your Redis databases in one place.
  Our monitoring quickstart includes a pre-built dashboard that displays aggregated metrics from all of your Redis instances, with the ability to filter the data for specific analyses.
  ### Why monitor Redis with New Relic?
  New Relic Redis for OpenTelemetry quickstart gives you comprehensive visibility into your Redis databases alongside your apps and server infrastructure. Monitoring Redis is vital to obtain real-time performance metrics for databases across your entire environment. This ensures optimal database operations, leading to better application performance and enhanced user experiences.
