  ## 1. CPU Usage:
  - This metric measures the percentage of the CPU's processing capacity that is being utilized at a given time. It indicates how much of the CPU's resources are being used by various processes and applications. A higher CPU usage may indicate heavy computational tasks or processes consuming resources, potentially impacting system performance.

  ## 2. Storage Usage:
  - This metric represents the proportion of available storage space that is currently being used. It indicates the level of data storage consumption on the system. Consistent or increasing storage usage may suggest growing data volumes or inadequate storage management practices.

  ## 3. Memory Usage:
  - Memory usage measures the percentage of available RAM (Random Access Memory) that is currently in use by running processes and applications. It reflects how efficiently the system is managing its memory resources. Higher memory usage can lead to performance degradation or even system instability if the available memory becomes insufficient for running processes.

  ## 4. Network Traffic Tx (Transmission): 
  - This metric tracks the amount of data being transmitted over the network, specifically outbound traffic. It indicates the volume of data being sent from the system to other devices or servers on the network. Significant changes in network traffic can indicate variations in user activity, application behavior, or potential network issues affecting communication between systems.



  ### Benefits:
  - Performance Optimization: By monitoring CPU usage, memory usage, and storage usage, administrators can identify resource-intensive processes or applications. They can take actions such as optimizing code, fine-tuning configurations, or allocating additional resources to ensure smooth system operation and performance.
  - Capacity Planning: Continuous monitoring of storage usage and memory usage allows administrators to anticipate future resource requirements. They can make informed decisions about upgrading hardware or provisioning additional resources to accommodate growing demands, thereby preventing resource shortages and performance degradation.
  - Troubleshooting and Issue Resolution: Monitoring network traffic can help detect abnormalities or performance bottlenecks in the network infrastructure. Administrators can investigate network congestion, latency issues, or potential security threats and take appropriate actions to resolve them promptly, ensuring uninterrupted communication and data transfer.

summary: |
  Monitoring CPU usage, storage usage, memory usage, and network traffic provides valuable insights into system performance and resource utilization. This allows administrators to optimize performance, plan for future capacity needs, troubleshoot issues, perform proactive maintenance, allocate resources efficiently, and set alerts for abnormal conditions. Ultimately, monitoring these metrics enhances system reliability, security, and efficiency.
