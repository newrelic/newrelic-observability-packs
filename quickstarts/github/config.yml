  ## What is GitHub Dependabot?

  GitHub Dependabot helps you keep your dependencies up to date. Every day, it checks your dependency files for outdated requirements and opens individual PRs for any it finds. You review, merge, and get to work on the latest, most secure releases.

  ### Get started!

  Start ingesting Dependabot events by connecting GitHub to New Relic!

  Check out our GitHub Dependabot documentation to instrument your GitHub account to send Vulnerability events to New Relic's Vulnerability Management product.

  ### Get a single view of the vulnerability surface area of your software with New Relic Vulnerability Management

  Integrate security findings from GitHub Dependabot with our native common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) detection and [any other of your assessment tools](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/security-data-api/) for rich, actionable security insights in the context of all of your telemetry data with [New Relic Vulnerability Management](https://newrelic.com/platform/vulnerability-management).
