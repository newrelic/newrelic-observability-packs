  ## What is NetScaler?

  NetScaler is a networking product and application delivery controller (ADC) that improves the delivery of applications to end users.

  ### About this integration

  With the NetScaler New Relic integration, you can gain visibility into your NetScaler analytics.

  ### Using the NetScaler dashboard

  This dashboard is created assuming the 'Bot' event. For other events (WAF etc.) you can change the event name in the query, or explore the events directly in [New Relic's events explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/)
