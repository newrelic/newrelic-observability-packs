  ## What is Azure SQL Elastic pools?

  Azure SQL Elastic pools are a simple, cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases that have varying and unpredictable usage demands. The databases in an elastic pool are on a single server and share a set number of resources at a set price. Elastic pools in SQL Database enable software as a service (SaaS) developers to optimize the price performance for a group of databases within a prescribed budget while delivering performance elasticity for each database.
