  ## What is Azure Personalizer?
  
   Azure Personalizer is an AI service that your applications make smarter decisions at scale using reinforcement learning. Personalizer processes information about the state of your application, scenario, and/or users (contexts), and a set of possible decisions and related attributes (actions) to determine the best decision to make. Feedback from your application (rewards) is sent to Personalizer to learn how to improve its decision-making ability in near-real time.
