  ## Why should you monitor your usage of Amazon Bedrock?
  Monitor your application powered by Amazon Bedrock language models to ensure, get visibility to what you send to Amazon Bedrock, responses received from Amazon Bedrock , latency, usage and errors. By monitoring the usage, you can infer the cost. 
  ### Track the LLM's performance:  
  Monitor the input & output, latency and errors of your LLM provider. Track performance changes with the providers and versions of your LLM.  Monitor usage to understand the cost, rate limits, and general performance.
  ### Track your app:
  By tracking key metrics like latency, throughput, error rates, and input & output, you can gain insights into your LangChain app's performance and identify areas of improvement. 
  ### Early issue detection:
