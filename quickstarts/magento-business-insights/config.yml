  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for Magento Business Insights
  Magento Business Insights involves tracking key performance indicators and other metrics in real-time, to ensure that the system is performing optimally and to identify potential issues before they become major problems.
  ## Why monitor your Magento app?
  Magento Ecommerce store monitoring is crucial to ensuring that the system is functioning smoothly and providing accurate data insights.
  There are several reasons for this:
  ### Revenue tracking:
  Monitoring Magento Ecommerce store allows business owners and ecommerce managers to track revenue performance in real-time, ensuring that sales data is accurate and up-to-date. This information can be critical for making informed decisions around marketing and inventory management.
  ### Downtime impact: 
  A business's revenue can be directly affected by downtime if customers are unable to purchase. Keeping track of downtime and lost revenue can help businesses quantify the impact of these issues.
  ### Order tracking: 
  With Magento Business Insights, businesses can monitor order details such as total orders, average order value, and latest orders in order to get insight into their customer's buying behavior.
  ### Customer details: 
  Analyzing customer details, such as new vs. returning customers and cart abandonment rates, can help businesses better understand their target market.
  ### Funnel monitoring: 
  A funnel monitor tracks and analyzes the behavior of customers as they move through your e-commerce site. By monitoring the funnel, businesses can identify where customers are dropping off and where they need to improve the user experience to drive conversions.
