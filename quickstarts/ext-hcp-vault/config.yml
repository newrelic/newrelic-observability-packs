  The HCP Vault quickstart allows you to get visibility into the performance and available of your HCP Vault service and dependencies. Use this quickstart together with the mock up integrations.

  ## HCP Vault quickstart highlights

  The New Relic quickstart uses dashboards to proactively monitor your HCP Vault servers, like:
  - whether a cluster node has been sealed by a user or during startup
  - number of authentication requests handled
  - the duration of requests handled
  
  ## Monitoring HCP Vault

  This quickstart utilizes New Relic's ability to ingest Prometheus data (either from our OpenMetrics integration or via Prometheus remote write). See instructions for [sending Prometheus data to New Relic here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

  ### How do I configure my integration to scrape HCP Vault severs?

  The approach to getting your Prometheus metrics into New Relic differs depending on which integration you use.

  #### Prometheus Remote Write

  In addition to setting up your `remote_write` configuration as described [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/), you will need to add the following scrape configuration to your `prometheus.yml` config file:

  ```
  - job_name: 'vault'
    metrics_path: "/v1/sys/metrics"
    params:
      format: ['prometheus']
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
      ca_file: your_ca_here.pem
    bearer_token: "your_vault_token_here"
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['your_vault_server_here:8200']
  ```
  (This helpful Prometheus job defnition sourced from [HCP Vault Telemetry](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/telemetry))

  Then, after reloading Prometheus config, you can check that your HCP Vault pods are appearing under your [Prometheus targets](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#targets).
