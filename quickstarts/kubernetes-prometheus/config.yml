  ## What is Kubernetes?
  Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and, management of containerized applications. The New Relic Kubernetes (Prometheus) monitoring quickstart utilizes Prometheus to give you visibility into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads in minutes, whether your clusters are hosted on-premises or in the cloud.
  Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration/) to install the New Relic Kubernetes integration.

  ## What is Prometheus?
  Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.

  ### Kubernetes (Prometheus) quickstart highlights
  The New Relic Prometheus quickstart for Kubernetes utilizes the [New Relic Prometheus agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent/) to build dashboards that allow you to proactively monitor your metrics, like:
  - memory and cpu utilization
  - running pods and containers
  - kubelet pod start metrics
  - compute resources by pod, node, cluster, and namespace and more.

  ### Requirements
  - Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent/) to install the New Relic Prometheus agent.
  - **The default installation of the New Relic Prometheus configurator does not enable all of the metrics needed to work with this quickstart's dashboards. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/main/examples/kubernetes/README.md) to enable those metrics.
summary: |
  Monitoring Kubernetes is crucial to gain instant visibility into Kubernetes clusters and workloads.
  Prometheus' ability to monitor a wide variety of data necessitates monitoring the toolkit itself. New Relic helps store, manage, and view telemetry data from your Prometheus setup, relieving you of a significant operational burden.
  Download the New Relic Kubernetes (Prometheus) quickstart to proactively monitor Kubernetes cluster health and capacity.

      New Relic's Prometheus agent is a thin wrapper on top of Prometheus server to run it in agent mode. With this integration, you can create a YAML configuration file used by Prometheus that's ready to send metrics to New Relic.

      The New Relic Kubernetes integration has multiple components that work together to give you end-to-end observability across your clusters. While you have the flexibility to deploy the components that you prefer, to achieve full observability, you need to install the complete package to monitor all metrics.
