  The Kong quickstart allows you to get visibility into the performance and available of your kong service and dependencies. Use this quickstart together with the mock up integrations.
  \## Kong quickstart highlights
  The New Relic quickstart uses dashboards to proactively monitor your Kong services, like:
  - Current Nginx HTTP Connections
  - Nginx Errors Total
  - Datastore Reachable

  
  ## Monitoring Kong
  This quickstart utilizes New Relic's ability to ingest Prometheus data (either from our OpenMetrics integration or via Prometheus remote write). See instructions for [sending Prometheus data to New Relic here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).
  ### How do I configure my integration to scrape Kong services metrics?
  The approach to getting your Prometheus metrics into New Relic differs depending on which integration you use.
  #### Prometheus Remote Write
  In addition to setting up your `remote_write` configuration as described [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/), you will need to follow these steps:
  
    1- You need to enable Kong Plugin for Prometheus following these instructions [here](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/prometheus/)
  
    2- After that, you can add this job configuration to prometheus.yml config file:
    ```
      - job_name: "kong"

        # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
        # scheme defaults to 'http'.

        static_configs:
          - targets:
            - 54.152.136.79:8001 
    ```

  
  Then, after reloading Prometheus config, you can check that your Ambassador metrics are appearing under your [Prometheus targets](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#targets).
