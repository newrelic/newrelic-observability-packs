  The Gatsby quickstart allows you to get visibility into the build time of your Gatsby Sites,
  using [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/introduction-opentelemetry-new-relic/)
  to collect each step as a span in a Distributed Trace. This quickstart takes events, metrics, logs, and traces from the `gatsby-build-newrelic` plugin and allows us to contextualize and identify performance issues within our plugins, 3rd party APIs, and other parts of our website.
