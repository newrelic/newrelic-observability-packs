  ## What is Google Cloud Bigtable?

  Cloud Bigtable is a sparsely populated table that can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns, enabling you to store terabytes or even petabytes of data. A single value in each row is indexed; this value is known as the row key. Bigtable is ideal for storing large amounts of single-keyed data with low latency. It supports high read and write throughput at low latency, and it's an ideal data source for MapReduce operations.
