  ## CircleCI Quickstart

  The world’s best software teams use CircleCI to deliver quality code with confidence. As the largest continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platform, CircleCI empowers engineers to seamlessly take ideas to execution, at scale. Every feature of our platform is built to fine-tune the entire development process from start to finish.
