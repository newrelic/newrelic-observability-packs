  The Snyk quickstart allows you to send application security vulnerabilities of your services into New Relic. We leverage webhooks on the Snyk platform to trigger an Azure Function App that acts as a proxy between Snyk and New Relic.

  ### Get a single view of the vulnerability surface area of your software with New Relic Vulnerability Management

  Integrate security findings from GitHub Dependabot with our native common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) detection and [any other of your assessment tools](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/security-data-api/) for rich, actionable security insights in the context of all of your telemetry data with [New Relic Vulnerability Management](https://newrelic.com/platform/vulnerability-management).

  Create a powerful, unified source of truth for developers, ops and security teams, eliminate silos to address and minimize security blindspots with full-stack context for faster error resolution that eliminates organizational silos.
