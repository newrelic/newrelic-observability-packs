  ## What is StatsD?

  Lightweight, open-source Node.js application that listens for metrics from different applications and aggregates them.

  ### Common StatsD use cases

  StatsD makes it easier for you to instrument your applications. As a developer or organization, it empowers you to code quickly troubleshoot application issues in real-time, and have absolute control over your data.

  With StatsD, you can collect metrics from your production applications, even before the apps are deployed into production. In addition,  resource utilization metrics can be directly linked to product metrics relevant to your organization.
