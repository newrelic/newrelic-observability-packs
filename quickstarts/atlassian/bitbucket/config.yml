  ## Atlassian Bitbucket quickstart

  ### About Bitbucket

  With best-in-class Jira integration, and built-in CI/CD, Bitbucket Cloud is the native Git tool in Atlassianâ€™s Open DevOps solution.

  ### About this quickstart

  This quickstart is built around a [Bitbucket Pipe](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines/integrations) integration. This tool will enable you to send CI/CD events into New Relic, where you can monitor your Bitbucket Pipelines.

  With this visualization you can monitor:
    - Number of events/pipeline builds
    - Track priority events
    - Real time event log from your pipeline
    - Events and priority events over time

  Monitor your Bitbucket Pipeline.
