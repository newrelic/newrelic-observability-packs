  ## About this quickstart

  This quickstart is the fastest way to jump straight into monitoring your end-to-end development logs.

  ### Log parsing

  For the serverless function monitoring, you will need to set-up a quick log parsing rule in order for the data to parse properly into the correct fields. Here are the steps to complete this.

  1. Open your [log viewer in New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/logger)
  2. Select the "Parsing" option under manage data
  3. Select "+Create parsing rule"
  4. Set the query to "`source` = 'lambda'"
  5. Copy/paste this parsing rule into the parsing logic `%{UUID:requestid}%{DATA}%{BASE16FLOAT:duration} %{DATA} %{BASE16FLOAT:billed_duration} %{DATA} %{INT:max_mem} %{DATA} %{INT:used_mem}`


  ### Core monitoring
