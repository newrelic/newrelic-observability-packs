# Name of the alert
name: low cache hit ratio

# Description and details
details: |+
  This alert is triggered whenever the cache hit ratio for database is < 0.85.
  The cache hit ratio can be measured simply by: # of cache hits/ # of total read responses.
  The cache hit ratio represents the proportion of block requests satisfied by the cache without requiring a disk read. 
  A low cache hit score means that the database is inefficient.

# Type of alert
