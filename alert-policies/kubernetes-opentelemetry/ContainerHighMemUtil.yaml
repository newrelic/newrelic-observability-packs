name: Container high memory utilization
# Description and details
description: |
  Alert when the average container memory utilization (vs. Limit) is > 90% for more than 5 minutes

# Type of alert: BASELINE | STATIC
type: STATIC

# NRQL query
nrql:
  query: "from Metric select max(container_memory_working_set_bytes) / filter(max(kube_pod_container_resource_limits), where resource = 'memory') where k8s.cluster.name in ('YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME') and k8s.namespace.name in ('YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME') facet pod, container, k8s.namespace.name, k8s.cluster.name"

# Direction in which baseline is set (Default: LOWER_ONLY)
# baselineDirection: LOWER_ONLY | UPPER_AND_LOWER | UPPER_ONLY

# Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE)
valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE

# List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition
terms:
  - priority: CRITICAL
    # Operator used to compare against the threshold.
    operator: ABOVE
    # Value that triggers a violation
    threshold: 90
    # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600, must be a multiple of 60 for Baseline conditions
    thresholdDuration: 300
    # How many data points must be in violation for the duration
    thresholdOccurrences: ALL

  # Adding a Warning threshold is optional
  # - priority: WARNING
  #   # Operator used to compare against the threshold.
  #   operator: ABOVE
  #   # Value that triggers a violation
  #   threshold: 0
  #   # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600, must be a multiple of 60 for Baseline conditions
  #   thresholdDuration: 60
  #   # How many data points must be in violation for the duration
  #   thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE

# Loss of Signal Settings
expiration:
  # Close open violations if signal is lost (Default: false)
  closeViolationsOnExpiration: true
  # Open "Loss of Signal" violation if signal is lost (Default: false)
  openViolationOnExpiration: false
  # Time in seconds; Max value: 172800 (48hrs), null if closeViolationsOnExpiration and openViolationOnExpiration are both 'false'
  expirationDuration: 300

# Advanced Signal Settings
# Duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL Condition
signal:
  # How long we wait for data that belongs in each aggregation window
  aggregationDelay: 60 # seconds
  # The method that determines when we consider an aggregation window to complete so that we can evaluate the signals for violations.
  aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW
  # How long we wait after each data point arrives to make sure we've processed the whole batch.
  aggregationTimer: null # seconds
  # Controls the duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL query
  aggregationWindow: 300 # seconds; 30 seconds <= x < 15 minutes
  # Option that determines the type of value that should be used to fill gaps (empty windows).
  fillOption: NONE # defaults to STATIC
  # If using the static fill option, this value is used for filling.
  fillValue: null # default
  # This setting gathers data in overlapping time windows to smooth the chart line, making it easier to spot trends.
  slideBy: 60 # seconds
  # Evaluation delay is how long we wait before we start evaluating a signal against the thresholds in this condition.
  evaluationDelay: 60

# OPTIONAL: URL of runbook to be sent with notification
runbookUrl:

# Duration after which a violation automatically closes
# Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day])
violationTimeLimitSeconds: 21600
