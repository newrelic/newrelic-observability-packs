name: Pinecone Request Latency

description: |+
  - This metric illustrates the server-side processing latency distribution for
  Pinecone data plane calls
  - An alert is triggered if the 50th percentile exceeds 100 ms
  - Resolution: If it surpasses 100 ms, we need to add another replica
type: STATIC
