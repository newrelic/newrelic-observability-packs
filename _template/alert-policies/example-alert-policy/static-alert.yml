terms:
  - priority: CRITICAL
    # Operator used to compare against the threshold.
    operator: ABOVE | ABOVE_OR_EQUALS | BELOW | BELOW_OR_EQUALS | EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS
    # Value that triggers a violation; float value
    threshold: 90
    # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600
    thresholdDuration: 600
    # How many data points must be in violation for the duration
    thresholdOccurrences: ALL | AT_LEAST_ONCE

  # Adding a Warning threshold is optional
  - priority: WARNING

# Loss of Signal Settings
expiration:

  # Open "Loss of Signal" violation if signal is lost (Default: false)
  openViolationOnExpiration: true | false
  # Time in seconds; Max value: 172800 (48hrs), null if closeViolationsOnExpiration and openViolationOnExpiration are both 'false'

# Advanced Signal Settings
# Duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL Condition
signal:
  # How long we wait for data that belongs in each aggregation window 
  aggregationDelay: 1200 # seconds
  # The method that determines when we consider an aggregation window to complete so that we can evaluate the signals for violations.
  aggregationMethod: CADENCE | EVENT_FLOW | EVENT_TIMER
  # How long we wait after each data point arrives to make sure we've processed the whole batch.
  aggregationTimer: 1200 # seconds
  # Controls the duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL query 
  aggregationWindow: 1200 # seconds; 30 seconds <= x < 15 minutes
  # Option that determines the type of value that should be used to fill gaps (empty windows).
  fillOption: STATIC | NONE | LAST_VALUE # defaults to STATIC
  # If using the static fill option, this value is used for filling.

  # This setting gathers data in overlapping time windows to smooth the chart line, making it easier to spot trends.
