description: |
  Kentik is built around the Kentik Data Engine (KDE), which gathers flow records (e.g. NetFlow or sFlow) sent by your data sources (network devices, hosts, clouds) and enriches them with additional data (SNMP, GeoIP, BGP, threat feeds, etc.) before storing them (redundantly) in a time-series database. Kentik Firehose provides the ability to simultaneously send the same enriched flow records that are ingested by KDE to a location of your choice, which enables you to integrate the data into other (non-Kentik) analytics systems, either directly or through a data lake.
